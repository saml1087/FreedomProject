      Steps to build a computer
      <ol class="alignment">
        <li> First, open up your motherboard and place it on top of its box (make sure you have already taken out everything from the motherboard box)</li>
        <li> IF you have an M.2 SSD, then you may insert it into the motherboard/ If not, you may ignore this step.</li>
        <li> Afterwards, take out the CPU, and insert it onto the motherboard slot. (Align the arrows from both the CPU and motherboard. The CPU goes in only ONE way)</li>
        <li> IF you're using a fan cooler, then you may install the fan on top of the CPU. Make sure thermal paste is already applied. If the thermal paste is not applied already, put a "Pea" sized amount onto the middle of the CPU. In theory, the CPU cooler should spread out the paste evenly once put on. </li>
        <li> Next, just install the memory (RAM) into the motherboard. If you have two sticks of memory, you should refer to the motherboard manual to see how to insert it. Usually it's slots A and C / B and D
        <li> It's time to insert the motherboard into the case. Grab the case, lay it down, and open the side panel. Make sure that your case has standoffs to hold up the motherboard. If not, please put them on. Afterwards, you can place the motherboard onto the case, and screw it down with the motherboard standoffs.</li>
        <li>Now you should be able to have the case standing upright. Depending on your case, you should be able to insert the PSU on the bottom of the case. Usually, it's best that the fan is facing down for better ventilation. </li>
        <li> You can screw down the PSU onto the case to secure its location. (Keep in mind, if you have a fully modular power supply, meaning that you have to attach your own cables, you may do it now) </li>
        <li> For Storage, you can either mount it on the bottom of the case or around the sidepanel/ It's completely up to you. Then connect the Sata data cable into the motherboard and the drive. You will also need to insert the SATA Power cable from the Power Supply into the motherboard. </li>
        <li>Now's also the time to add any extra fans to your case to improve airflow. This setup is completely up to you. Generally,fans are placed intake at the front of the case, and the fans are placed as exhaust at the back of the case.</li>
        <li> Now it comes down to the cables and securing it. </li>
        <li> The fan cooler cables should be plugged into the motherboard/ The Front Panel Cables should also be plugged into the motherboard.</li>
        <li> The rest of the motherboard should be powered by the PSU. Make sure the 24-pin of the Power Supply connects firmly into the motherboard (usually located at the side). </li>
        <li> The Graphics Card will also need a cable connected it from the Power Supply, (usually a 6 pin depending on the card) and connect those so they are powered up. </li>
        <li> Lastly just fix up all of the cables and put back the side panel! </li>
