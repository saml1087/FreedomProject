# FreedomProject

**Context**

The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about implementing the ideas we learned during our classwork and combining ideas with our own interests into a blog that would reflect our learning throughout the school year. The purpose of this blog is to inform the audience of what they will learn, and how it impacts the world socially, globally, and economically.

**Content**
For my project, I am making a website about Computer Hardware using Github, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Independent Computer Components and Assembling Parts Into a Computer and making the website.

**Implications**
This is important for all to know because it informs the readers about the components that actually build up your computer. This information allows a person to grasp a better understanding of components which can allow them to potentially upgrade their own computer. This way they know where to save their money and how they should spend it on their own computer.
