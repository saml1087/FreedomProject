# FreedomProject
Context
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about implementing the ideas we learned during our classwork and combining ideas with our own interests into a blog that would reflect our learning throughout the school year. The purpose of this blog is to inform the audience of what they will learn, and how it impacts the world socially, globally, and economically.

Content
For my project, I am making a website about Computer Hardware using Github, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Independent Computer Components and Assembling Parts Into a Computer and making the website.

Implications
Adding Information, as well as a visual representation of my product.
